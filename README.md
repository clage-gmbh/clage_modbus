## Hardware

* [CLAGE GmbH E-Moduldurchlauferhitzer ISX](https://www.clage.com/de/produkte/e-moduldurchlauferhitzer/isx) providing [**REST API**](https://github.com/clage-gmbh/rest_api) by WLAN and **Modbus RTU** by wire.

## Documentation

* REST API documentation can be found in [clage-gmbh/rest_api](https://github.com/clage-gmbh/rest_api).
* Modbus API documentation can be found in [this GitHub Wiki](../../wiki).

The mapping of the device parameters to the modbus register addresses is provided as a [CSV table](src/clage_modbus_mapping.csv) and a [Python map](src/clage_modbus_mapping.py).

For using the Modbus RTU interface there is an open source [command line tool written in Python](src/clage_modbus.py) to test and demonstrate the usage.
The command line tools can also be loaded as a module providing a Python class to access parameters of a CLAGE device.

## Safety notice

Modbus and EIA-485 do not provide any concepts for protection against unauthorized access.
Anyone who has access to the Modbus cable has the ability to control the devices connected to it.
If the Modbus cable is connected to other communication media (e.g. a gateway), this connection must be protected against unauthorized access.
For all installations, it must be noted that control via Modbus can also be used to perform safety-relevant functions such as the initial setting of the maximum power (MPS), thermal treatment, the opening of the water valve after automatic shut-off and others.
Anyone who controls a CLAGE instantaneous water heater via Modbus is responsible for implementing this in a secure manner.
